	<h1>The Beauty of Text Formatting In HTML</h1>

	<p>When writting content from the web, <b>bold text</b> can be used to highlight important points, while <strong>strong emphasis</strong> is often used for critical information.</p>

	<p>Sometimes, we may want to add <i>italicized</i> words to untriduce a softer emphasis, or we can use <em>emphasized</em> text for the same purpose. Meanwhile, if we need to highlight important information, the <mark> mark</mark> tag comes in handy.</p>

	<p>In certain cases, we use <small> small text </small> to indicate fine print or disclaimers. When referring to outdated or incorrect, we can apply <strike> deleted text </strike> to show that it has been removed, and if we want to indicate an addition, we can use <ins>inserted text </ins> instead.</p>

	<p>Underlining words is also possible with the <ins>underlined text </ins> tag, while <strike> strikethrough text </strike> is useful for indicating obsolate or invalid content.</p>
	<p>For mathematical expressions, we can use superscript like X<sup>2 </sup> or subscript H<sub>2</sub>O to properly format equations.</p>

	<p>When showcasting code snippets, we use the <code>code element</code>. If we want to demonstrate keyboard shortcuts, the <kbd>ctrl + c</kbd> formarts works well. Additionally, sample output can be shown using the <samp> sample text</samp> tag, and variable  names can be formatted using <var>var_name.</var> </p>

	To preserve exact spacing and formatting, we can use
	<pre>preformatted text</pre>
	<p>. which keeps the layout as written.</p>

	Quoting text can be done in two ways: inline quotes like <q>This is an inline quote.</q> or block quotes such as: 
		<p><blockquote>"This is a block quotation, typically used for longer excerpts."</blockquote></p>

   <p> We often see abbreviations like<abbr> W.W.W</abbr>, which can provide additional context when hovered over. When citing a source, we can use <cite>cite tags </cite> to give credit where due.</p>

   <p> To define terms, the <dfn> definition element</dfn> can be applied. Lastly, for handling right-to-left languages, we can use</p dir="ltr"> tfel ot thgir morf swolf txet siht</ </p>

   <p>As you can see, HTML provides a rich set of formatting tools that help enhance readability, structure, and meaning in web content.</p>
